 The value for the animation-name and the name of the keyframe for that animation must match. 
 Numbers and special characters cannot be first character in the name of the animation. 
 If animation-name  not set, then animation will not happen. 
 If  animation-duration property is omitted, then animation will still happen. 
 In this case, the default value will be used, and that is 0 seconds. 
 Therefore this animation will be instant. 
 It will happen, but so quickly, we will not be able to see it. 
 The animation-timing-function is applied to beginning and end of the keyframe.
